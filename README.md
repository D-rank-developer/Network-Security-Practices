## Network Security Practices – Module Description

Computer networks are the backbone of modern society, connecting countries, cities, towns, and communities across the globe. These networks are expected to operate continuously and flawlessly, 24/7 and 365 days a year, as they handle massive volumes of financial, medical, entertainment, business, and governmental data that drive everyday life.

Maintaining such complex infrastructures requires proper knowledge, practical experience, and professional skill. Without these, deploying, expanding, developing, and securing networks would be nearly impossible.

This module introduces students to the fundamentals of networking through a **secure-by-design** approach. It also prepares learners for the professional expectations and standards required in the field, guiding them toward becoming competent and responsible practitioners in modern network security.
