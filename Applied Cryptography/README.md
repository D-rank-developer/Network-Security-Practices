# Applied Cryptography Lab: Hash Functions in Network Security

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, **I will be able to**:

* Develop a clear and practical understanding of **cryptographic hash functions**, including their core security properties such as determinism, pre-image resistance, second pre-image resistance, and collision resistance.

* Identify and explain how **hash functions are used in real-world network protocols and security applications**, including authentication systems, integrity checks, digital signatures, and secure communications.

* Experimentally demonstrate and explain the **avalanche effect**, showing how small changes in input data produce significantly different hash outputs.

* Analyse common **vulnerabilities in password storage and authentication systems**, and understand why insecure hashing practices lead to data breaches.

* Understand **rainbow table attacks**, how they work, and why modern defence mechanisms such as salting, key stretching, and adaptive hashing algorithms are essential.

* Apply cryptographic hash functions to **practical network security scenarios**, strengthening my foundational skills for cybersecurity analysis, system hardening, and secure system design.

This lab supports my long-term goal of building strong fundamentals in **cybersecurity and applied cryptography**, enabling me to reason about real-world security problems rather than relying solely on theoretical knowledge.
